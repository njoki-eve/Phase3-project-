# Phase3-project- 

Health Simplified CLI Application

 A command-line tool to help users manage their nutrition goals, track daily food intake, and plan weekly meals—designed for busy professionals and developer students.

📌 Project Overview
Health Simplified is a Python-based CLI application that enables users to:

Log and review meals
Set and track daily and weekly nutrition goals
Generate weekly meal plans
View reports on their progress
This project is built to reinforce object-oriented programming (OOP), CLI tooling with typer, and SQLAlchemy with a PostgreSQL backend. It also emphasizes clean software practices, modular design, and unit testing.

🎯 Objectives
📚 Educational
Reinforce key CS concepts: OOP, inheritance, and composition
Practice SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL
Apply CLI application architecture using Typer
Gain experience with testing and packaging Python applications
✅ Functional
Provide a full-featured CLI for nutrition tracking
Include CRUD operations for users, food entries, goals, and meal plans
Implement input validation, error handling, and reports
Package the tool for easy installation (pip install .)
